9. [] Keep the default program features and click the **Next** button on the **Program features** step.

> Note: The installation process can take up to 25 minutes, please have some patience. The installation takes quite some time because many components need to be installed such as Microsoft SQL Server, Veeam Backup & Replication, Veaam ONE and of course Veeam Availability Orchestrator.

17. [] Click the **Finish** button to close the VeeamÂ® Availability Orchestrator setup wizard.
18. [] Click the **Yes** button to logoff the VEEAM-VAO server.
> Note: Logoff is required because during installation of Veeam ONE, a local group named Veeam ONE Administrators is created and a user is added to it. In this lab environment you will automatically be logged back into the Desktop.
